To start the application with Docker go to the terminal of your IDE and type the command
$ docker-compose up

It will then take a while to download the services but after a few moments you are able to access mongo-express at http://localhost:8081/

and the html websites at
http://localhost:5000/

(all this with given that docker is set up on your PC aswell as in your IDE etc.)
